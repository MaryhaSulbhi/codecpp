# C++ and SQL Practice Workspace

This workspace contains C++ code examples and SQL scripts for learning and practicing programming concepts.

## Files

- [code.cpp](code.cpp):  
  A collection of C++ code snippets demonstrating basic programming concepts, input/output, operators, conditionals, loops, and pattern printing.

- [SQL.sql](SQL.sql):  
  SQL script to create and manipulate an `employees` table. Includes table creation, data insertion, updates, and various queries for practice.

## Usage

### C++

1. Open `code.cpp` in your C++ IDE (such as Visual Studio Code).
2. Uncomment the code snippet you want to run.
3. Compile and execute the file:
   ```sh
   g++ code.cpp -o code.exe
   ./code.exe
   ```

### SQL

1. Open `SQL.sql` in your SQL client.
2. Connect to your MySQL database (see `.vscode/settings.json` for connection details).
3. Run the script to create the table and practice queries.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- MySQL server (for running SQL scripts)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended, with C++ and SQL extensions)

## Notes

- The C++ file contains multiple code snippets, mostly commented out. Uncomment the section you want to test.
- The SQL file demonstrates basic table operations and queries for learning purposes.

Happy coding!
